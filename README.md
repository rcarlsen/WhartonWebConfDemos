=================================

Demo apps shown at the 2013 Wharton Web Conference
as examples of connecting to Bluetooth Smart (BLE) accessories.

Used the TI SensorTag for the Temperature, Proximity and Clicker demos. Get one here:

Can use any accessory which provides the Heart Rate Service for the
Heart Rate demo; I used the Wahoo Fitness HR strap.
